    <h2>Acquiring Aggregate</h2>
    <p>Aggregates, which are crushed minerals, have to be obtained somewhere. Usually, this entails visiting an aggregate bank (How Concrete is Made 3), which has to get their sand somewhere. Many times, this entails digging up minerals from a river (Ramsden 2), which can cause a change in the river's flow, possibly disrupting the ecosystem.</p>
    <h2>Firing Process</h2>
    <p>Concrete is a mixture of aggregate and cement. The cement manufacturing process is where most of the emissions come from. Cement is made by firing clay, limestone, and various other additives in a furnace. According to Keegan Ramsden from Princeton University, "each pound of concrete [manufactured] releases 0.93 pounds of carbon dioxide" (3). Obviously, this isn't great for the atmosphere, seing as concrete is one of the most essential resources we have, second only to water.</p>
