    <h2>Green Cement</h2>
    <p>In New Jersey, a company named Solida is finding a good use for the Carbon Dioxide that results from the
      manufacturing process (Ramsden 7). The carbon is captured and used in a mixture to fill up the empty spaces in the
      recently made cement, as well as being used to cure the cement. It can reduce the emissions in the process by
      seventy percent (Ramsden 7). However, few companies do this and the product may be more expensive and is more scarce,</p>
    <h2>Carbon Sequestration</h2>
    <p>Carbon Sequestration, a technology that captures Carbon Dioxide present in the atmosphere is an expensive but
      effective solution for reducing the impact of all manner of industries. However, it is still impractical for most
      plants due to its steep cost, running more than $600 per ton of CO2 (Ramsden 8).</p>
